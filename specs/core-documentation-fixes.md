# Core Documentation Fixes Plan

## Overview
This plan addresses the critical shortcomings in the .NET documentation system identified in `massive-problem.txt`. The core issues are:

1. **Missing XML Documentation Elements**: Critical tags like `<returns>`, `<exception>`, `<typeparam>`, `<value>`, and `<seealso>` are not being extracted
2. **Incorrect Semantic Mappings**: `<summary>` incorrectly maps to `Usage` property instead of `Summary`
3. **Architectural Problems**: Doc* objects are too tightly coupled to ISymbol, preventing proper mutation through the pipeline
4. **Incomplete API Documentation**: Generated docs lack essential information developers expect

## Completed Work

### Prerequisite: Global Namespace Handling
- [x] Removed `IgnoreGlobalModule` parameter from AssemblyManager
- [x] Updated ProcessNamespace to always skip global namespace
- [x] Removed `IgnoreGlobalModule` property from ProjectContext
- [x] Updated tests to remove dual baseline scenarios
- [x] Deleted BasicAssembly_WithGlobals.json baseline
- [x] Updated all test methods to work without ignoreGlobalModule parameter

## Solution Architecture

### Phase 1: Create Intuitive Specification Document ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Produce "Easy As Fuck" documentation that both AI and humans can understand.

#### Specification Document Structure
- [x] Create `/specs/documentation-mapping-spec.md`
- [x] Document XML tag to property mappings with clear semantics
- [x] Include examples for each mapping type
- [x] Define conceptual vs XML documentation separation
- [x] Document pipeline transformation capabilities
- [x] Include decision trees for when to use each property type

#### Content Guidelines
- [x] Use simple language, avoid jargon
- [x] Include visual diagrams/flowcharts where helpful
- [x] Provide concrete examples for each concept
- [x] Include troubleshooting section for common issues

### Phase 2: Refactor Doc* Objects for Mutability ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Make Doc* objects independent of ISymbol after construction, allowing pipeline transformations while preserving original symbol data. Implement nullable properties for clean JSON/YAML serialization.

#### DocEntity Base Class Changes
- [x] Add `ISymbol OriginalSymbol` backing field to store original symbol reference
- [x] Modify constructor to accept `ISymbol` parameter and extract initial values
- [x] Add `Summary` property for XML `<summary>` content (separate from `Usage`) - nullable string
- [x] Add `Returns` property for XML `<returns>` content - nullable string
- [x] Add `Exceptions` collection for XML `<exception>` content - nullable collection
- [x] Add `TypeParameters` collection for XML `<typeparam>` content - nullable collection
- [x] Add `Value` property for XML `<value>` content (properties only) - nullable string
- [x] Add `SeeAlso` collection for XML `<seealso>` content - nullable collection
- [x] Keep existing `Remarks`, `Examples`, `BestPractices`, `Patterns`, `Considerations`, `RelatedApis` for conceptual content - make nullable where appropriate
- [x] Update all string properties to be nullable with null defaults to enable clean JSON/YAML serialization

#### Supporting Classes Created
- [x] Created `DocException` class for exception documentation
- [x] Created `DocTypeParameter` class for type parameter documentation

#### DocType Specific Changes
- [x] Inherit all base DocEntity changes (via base constructor)
- [x] Value property available from base class
- [x] TypeParameters available from base class

#### DocMember Specific Changes
- [x] Inherit all base DocEntity changes (via base constructor)
- [x] Returns property available from base class
- [x] Exceptions collection available from base class
- [x] TypeParameters available from base class

#### DocParameter Specific Changes
- [x] Keep existing `Usage` property for `<param>` content (inherited from base, nullable)
- [x] No additional XML extraction needed

#### DocNamespace Specific Changes
- [x] Removed duplicate `Summary` property (now inherited from base)
- [x] Updated constructor to call base constructor

#### DocAssembly Specific Changes
- [x] Updated constructor to call base constructor

#### Renderer Updates
- [x] Updated YamlRenderer to handle nullable properties correctly
- [x] Added null checks and conditional property additions to avoid null reference errors

### Phase 2.5: YamlRenderer Improvements ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Refactor YamlRenderer to use YamlDotNet's serialization capabilities properly.

#### YamlRenderer Refactoring
- [x] Configured YamlSerializer with proper settings (CamelCase, OmitNull, OmitDefaults, OmitEmptyCollections)
- [x] Implemented custom IYamlTypeConverter for Roslyn types (ISymbol, Accessibility, SymbolKind, TypeKind, RefKind)
- [x] Removed manual dictionary building methods (300+ lines of code removed)
- [x] Implemented direct object serialization like JsonRenderer
- [x] Ensured proper null handling without manual checks
- [x] Tested build and compilation success

### Phase 3: Update AssemblyManager Extraction Logic ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Extract all missing XML documentation elements with proper semantic mapping.

#### Core Extraction Methods
- [x] Create `ExtractReturns()` method in AssemblyManager.cs
- [x] Create `ExtractExceptions()` method in AssemblyManager.cs
- [x] Create `ExtractTypeParameters()` method in AssemblyManager.cs
- [x] Create `ExtractValue()` method in AssemblyManager.cs
- [x] Create `ExtractSeeAlso()` method in AssemblyManager.cs
- [x] Update `ExtractSummary()` to return nullable string and populate `Summary` instead of `Usage`
- [x] Update `ExtractRemarks()` to return nullable string
- [x] Update `ExtractExamples()` to return nullable string
- [x] Update `ExtractParameterDocumentation()` (already correct mapping)

#### Integration Points
- [x] Modify all extraction calls to populate new properties (Summary, Returns, Exceptions, TypeParameters, Value, SeeAlso)
- [x] Update method signatures to return nullable types where appropriate
- [x] Add null checks and validation for all extraction methods (handled via nullable types)
- [x] Handle edge cases (missing XML docs return null, malformed tags handled gracefully)

#### Additional Work Completed
- [x] Fixed YamlRendererTests by removing tests for obsolete internal methods
- [x] Fixed DocEntityTests and DocTypeTests to handle nullable collections
- [x] Added missing using statements for System.Collections.Generic and System.Linq
- [x] Fixed nullability issues in ExtractSeeAlso with Cast<string>() to handle type conversion
- [x] Successfully built entire solution with no errors

### Phase 3.4: Add Type Exclusion Capability ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Provide ability to exclude unwanted types from documentation, particularly those injected by tools like Microsoft.TestPlatform.

#### Problem Statement
Microsoft.TestPlatform injects types (MicrosoftTestingPlatformEntryPoint, SelfRegisteredExtensions) into test assemblies that shouldn't appear in documentation. Need flexible exclusion mechanism.

#### Implementation
- [x] Added `ExcludedTypes` property to ProjectContext as HashSet<string>
- [x] Implemented wildcard pattern matching for flexible type exclusion
- [x] Support patterns like "*.TypeName" to match type in any namespace
- [x] Support patterns like "Namespace.*.TypeName" for namespace wildcards
- [x] Added `IsTypeExcluded()` method to ProjectContext for pattern matching
- [x] Updated AssemblyManager to filter out excluded types during documentation generation
- [x] Simplified BuildModel signature to accept ProjectContext directly instead of individual properties

#### Testing
- [x] Verified exclusion of Microsoft.TestPlatform injected types
- [x] Tested wildcard pattern matching functionality
- [x] Confirmed documentation generation excludes specified types

### Phase 3.5: Fix Symbol Data Extraction Architecture ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Ensure ALL data needed for documentation is extracted from ISymbol during the build phase (AssemblyManager), not at render time. Renderers should only serialize pre-extracted data from properties.

#### Problem Statement
Currently, renderers are extracting data from ISymbol properties at render time (e.g., `Symbol.ToDisplayString()`, `Symbol.TypeKind.ToString()`). This violates the pipeline architecture where:
1. AssemblyManager should extract ALL needed data during build phase
2. Doc* objects should store all documentation data in properties
3. Renderers should ONLY serialize the properties, never access Symbol

#### Doc* Object Property Additions
- [x] Add `DisplayName` property to DocEntity (for full qualified name display)
- [x] Add `Name` property to DocNamespace (currently using Symbol.Name at render time)
- [x] Add `FullName` property to DocType (currently using Symbol.ToDisplayString())
- [x] Add `TypeKind` property to DocType (currently using Symbol.TypeKind)
- [x] Add `MemberKind` property to DocMember (currently using Symbol.Kind)
- [x] Add `Accessibility` property to DocMember (currently using Symbol.DeclaredAccessibility)
- [x] Add `ReturnTypeName` property to DocMember for methods (currently computed at render time)
- [x] Add `ParameterTypeName` property to DocParameter (currently using Symbol.Type.ToDisplayString())
- [x] Add any other Symbol-derived data currently extracted at render time

#### AssemblyManager Updates
- [x] Populate `DisplayName` during entity construction
- [x] Populate `Name` for DocNamespace during construction
- [x] Populate `FullName` and `TypeKind` for DocType during construction
- [x] Populate `MemberKind` and `Accessibility` for DocMember during construction
- [x] Populate `ReturnTypeName` for method members
- [x] Populate `ParameterTypeName` for DocParameter
- [x] Ensure ALL Symbol data needed by renderers is extracted upfront

#### Symbol Property Cleanup
- [x] Add `[JsonIgnore]` attribute to all public Symbol properties (already present)
- [x] Add `[YamlIgnore]` attribute to all public Symbol properties (handled by YamlTypeConverter)
- [x] Consider making Symbol properties internal if no external access is needed (kept public for extensibility)
- [x] Ensure OriginalSymbol backing field remains private (confirmed private)

#### Renderer Refactoring
- [x] Remove ALL Symbol access from JsonRenderer
- [x] Update JsonRenderer to serialize Doc* objects directly (not anonymous types)
- [x] Remove ALL Symbol access from MarkdownRenderer
- [x] Remove ALL Symbol access from YamlRenderer (already mostly done)
- [x] Remove GetReturnType, GetMemberSignature and similar methods that extract from Symbol
- [x] Ensure renderers ONLY use properties from Doc* objects

### Phase 5: Update Rendering Pipeline (Depends on Phase 3.5) ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Ensure renderers can access and display all extracted documentation elements.

#### JsonRenderer Updates ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Add `summary`, `returns`, `exceptions`, `typeParameters`, `value`, `seeAlso` fields to JSON output (via direct serialization)
- [x] Update `JsonRendererOptions` if needed for new field control (already configured correctly)
- [x] Leverage nullable properties for automatic exclusion of empty values in JSON output
- [x] Simplified to direct serialization of Doc* objects (removed ~130 lines of manual mapping)
- [x] Updated JsonRendererTests to work with new structure

#### MarkdownRenderer Updates ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Fixed to use RendererBase methods (GetNamespaceFilePath, GetTypeFilePath) for consistent file path generation
- [x] Removed manual path construction with hardcoded underscores
- [x] Now respects FileNamingOptions configuration (defaults to hyphens as separators)
- [x] Properly uses inherited methods from RendererBase for file naming
- [x] Add sections for Returns, Exceptions, Type Parameters, Value, See Also
- [x] Update markdown templates to include new documentation sections
- [x] Skip empty sections to maintain clean markdown output
  - Returns section implemented (lines 560-570 for methods)
  - Exceptions section implemented (lines 478-491 for types, 597-610 for members)
  - Type Parameters section implemented (lines 379-388 for types, 585-595 for members)
  - Value section implemented (lines 573-583 for properties)
  - See Also section implemented (lines 133-142, 229-238, 493-502, 647-656 at all levels)
  - Empty sections automatically skipped via null/empty checks
- [x] Fixed duplicate Returns section issue for properties (added MemberKind check)
- [x] Changed "Overview" and "Description" headers to "Usage" for 1:1 property mapping
- [x] Added .dll extension to assembly names in Definition section (matches Microsoft docs)
- [x] Fixed property signatures to show get/set accessors (created PropertySignatureFormat)
- [x] Fixed method signatures to show fully qualified type names (updated DocumentationSignatureFormat)
- [x] Identified all non-1:1 mappings between section headers and property names:
  - "Related APIs" → RelatedApis property (spacing/casing difference)
  - "Definition" section → composite of multiple properties (not a single property)
  - "Syntax" section → Signature property
  - "Property Value" section → Value property

#### YamlRenderer Updates ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Add corresponding YAML fields for all new documentation elements (via direct serialization)
- [x] Update YAML structure to maintain consistency with JSON/Markdown (automatic via serialization)
- [x] Leverage nullable properties for automatic exclusion of empty values in YAML output
- [x] Fixed all YamlRendererTests (3 tests were broken, now all passing)
- [x] Added proper FolderMode baseline generation for YamlRendererTests
- [x] Updated test expectations to match actual serialized structure
- [x] Fixed parameter type property expectation (parameterType vs type)
- [x] Removed incorrect modifiers field expectation from tests
- [x] Made boolean property checks flexible for YamlDotNet deserialization

### Phase 6: Comprehensive Unit Test Updates ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETED

### Test Infrastructure Line Ending Fixes ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Created `.gitattributes` file configured for Windows development with CRLF line endings
- [x] Converted all baseline files to CRLF (Windows line endings) for consistency
- [x] Updated all test comparison methods to normalize line endings before comparison:
  - MarkdownRendererTests.cs - 2 locations (CompareWithFolderBaseline and main test)

### Known Issues
- Exit code 8 issue: Some test projects (Tests.Shared, Tests.Plugins.AI, Tests.Mintlify) don't contain actual test methods but are being treated as test projects, causing MSTest to exit with code 8 ("No tests found")
  - These are support libraries, not test projects
  - Should either remove MSTest references or exclude from test discovery

# Callouts & Alerts Demo

<Note>
  Callouts draw attention to important information, warnings, tips, and other key details in your documentation.
</Note>

## üì¢ All Callout Types

### Note - General Information

<Note>
  This is a **Note** callout. Use it for general information that supplements the main content. Notes provide additional context without being critical to understanding.
</Note>

### Info - Additional Context

<Info>
  This is an **Info** callout. It provides supplementary information that enhances understanding. Perfect for "did you know" content or additional details.
</Info>

### Tip - Best Practices

<Tip>
  This is a **Tip** callout. Share best practices, recommendations, and helpful suggestions. Tips help users work more efficiently.
</Tip>

### Warning - Important Cautions

<Warning>
  This is a **Warning** callout. Alert users to potential issues, deprecated features, or important considerations. Warnings prevent problems before they occur.
</Warning>

### Check - Success Confirmation

<Check>
  This is a **Check** callout. Confirm successful operations, completed steps, or validate that requirements are met. Great for verification checkpoints.
</Check>

## üîê Security Callouts

<Warning>
  **Security Warning**: Never commit sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or connection strings to source control.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Security Best Practice**: Always use environment variables or secure configuration providers for sensitive data:
  ```csharp
  var apiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("API_KEY");
  ```
</Tip>

<Check>
  **Security Validation**: All input is properly sanitized and validated before processing.
</Check>

## ‚ö° Performance Callouts

<Info>
  **Performance Info**: This operation uses lazy loading, meaning data is only fetched when accessed for the first time.
</Info>

<Tip>
  **Performance Tip**: For better performance with large collections, use `IAsyncEnumerable` instead of loading all items into memory:
  ```csharp
  await foreach (var item in GetItemsAsync())
  {
      await ProcessItemAsync(item);
  }
  ```
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Performance Warning**: This method performs database queries in a loop. Consider using batch operations or includes to reduce database round trips.
</Warning>

## üîÑ Version Compatibility

<Note>
  **Compatibility Note**: This API is available in .NET 6.0 and later versions.
</Note>

<Warning>
  **Breaking Change**: This method signature has changed in version 2.0. The old overload is marked as obsolete and will be removed in version 3.0.
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Migration Path**: To migrate from v1.x to v2.x:
  1. Update package references
  2. Replace deprecated methods
  3. Run migration tool
  4. Test thoroughly
</Info>

## üêõ Common Issues

<Warning>
  **Common Pitfall**: Forgetting to dispose of `IDisposable` objects can lead to memory leaks. Always use `using` statements:
  ```csharp
  using var stream = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open);
  // Stream is automatically disposed
  ```
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Debugging Tip**: Enable detailed logging to troubleshoot issues:
  ```csharp
  builder.Logging.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Debug);
  ```
</Tip>

<Note>
  **Known Issue**: On Linux systems, file paths are case-sensitive. Ensure your code handles path comparisons appropriately.
</Note>

## ‚úÖ Setup Verification

<Check>
  ‚úì Package installed successfully  
  ‚úì Configuration file created  
  ‚úì Database connection established  
  ‚úì All tests passing  
  ‚úì Ready for development!
</Check>

## üé® Combining Callouts

You can combine different callout types to create comprehensive documentation:

<Note>
  The following example demonstrates async file processing.
</Note>

```csharp
public async Task ProcessFileAsync(string path)
{
    using var stream = File.OpenRead(path);
    await ProcessStreamAsync(stream);
}
```

<Warning>
  This method does not check if the file exists before attempting to open it.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Add file existence validation for production use:
  ```csharp
  if (!File.Exists(path))
      throw new FileNotFoundException($"File not found: {path}");
  ```
</Tip>

<Info>
  **Best Practice**: Callouts should be used sparingly to maintain their effectiveness. Too many callouts can overwhelm readers.

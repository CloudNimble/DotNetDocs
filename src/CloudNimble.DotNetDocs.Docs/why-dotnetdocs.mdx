## Introduction

I've been a .NET developer for 25 years now, since the very early previews of the .NET Framework. In that time, I've seen technologies like the Web Forms, 
WCF Data Services, and Silverlight come and go. I've also seen the rise of open source, the growth of the cloud, and the pervasiveness of C#.

A .NET influencer once tweeted "When I ask myself 'What would have the most impact today?' I sit down and write documentation."

That has always stuck with me.

.NET has never had a truly fantastic documentation story. For a while, I had hoped DocFX would be the answer, but Microsoft kept all the best plugins for themselves and never
really contributed back to the platform in any meaningful way. I'm honestly not even sure what learn.microsoft.com is built on these days.

Meanwhile, DocFX has languished in open source, with few contributors and even fewer updates. It's clunky, hard to customize, and frankly, a pain to use. So many hours wasted... 
so much unrealized potential.

## The Rise of AI

In the last 18 months, documentation has gone from a "nice to have" to a requirement for AI coding tools. If the tool doesn't understand the code, it will generate shit.
Every. Single. Time.

It happened with my own code. It happened with other libraries. Babysitting the AI so it doesn't take a wrong turn. Explaining concepts to the AI when it did. Over and over 
and over again. My ample forehead flatened against my desk and my hair grayer from the experience.

Which brought me back to that quote again.

A full decade since that tweet, and there are no good solutions for .NET developers to follow that advice. GitHub Copilot can fill in your XML doc comments, but there's been
no place for them to go. It's long past time to change that.

With Claude at my fingertips, it was time to finally build the solution the .NET Ecosystem always deserved, so every .NET developer can be a better Context Engineer.

Six weekends later, it's finally ready. 

## Design Tenets

- It must be the simplest, most intuitive documenation system ever made
- It must make Documentation a first-class citizen in Visual Studio and VSCode
  - This means it should be able to edit content targeting any documentation platform
- It must be built for .NET 10 first and designed for the next 25 years of .NET development
- It must support standard formats but allow for premium experiences
- It MUST support weaving long-lived and dynamically-generated content together

### Extensible Architecture
```csharp
// Custom renderer example
services.AddDotNetDocsPipeline(pipeline =>
{
    pipeline.UseCustomRenderer<MyRenderer>()
           .AddTransformer<MyTransformer>()
           .ConfigureContext(ctx => { /* ... */ });
});
```

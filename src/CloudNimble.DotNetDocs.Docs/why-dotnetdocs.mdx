## Introduction

A .NET influencer once tweeted "When I ask myself 'What would have the most impact today?' I sit down and write documentation."

That has always stuck with me.

.NET has never had a truly fantastic documentation story. For a while, I had hoped DocFX would be the answer, but that didn't really pan out.

AI changed everything.

In the last 18 months, documentation has gone from a "nice to have" to a requirement for AI coding tools. If the tool doesn't understand the code, it will 
generate garbage. Every. Single. Time.

Which brought me back to that quote.

A full decade since that tweet, how are .NET developers to follow that advice? 

GitHub Copilot can fill in your XML doc comments, but there's been no truly fantastic place for them to be seen and understood.

With Claude at my fingertips, it was time to finally build the solution the .NET Ecosystem always deserved, so every .NET developer can be a better Context 
Engineer.

So try it out. Let us know what still needs work. Open up some issues and help us make this ecosystem we love that much better.

And write some great documentation.

## Design Tenets

- It must be the simplest, most intuitive documenation system ever made
- It must make Documentation a first-class citizen in Visual Studio and VSCode
  - This means it should be able to edit content targeting any documentation platform
- It must be built for .NET 10 first and designed for the next 25 years of .NET development
- It must support standard formats but allow for premium experiences
- It MUST support weaving long-lived and dynamically-generated content together

### Extensible Architecture
```csharp
// Custom renderer example
services.AddDotNetDocsPipeline(pipeline =>
{
    pipeline.UseCustomRenderer<MyRenderer>()
           .AddTransformer<MyTransformer>()
           .ConfigureContext(ctx => { /* ... */ });
});
```
